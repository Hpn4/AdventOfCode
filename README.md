# AdventOfCode
My solution for the AdventOfCode challenge in python

## How to use

Download input of the day:
- Put your cookie of your advent of code account in `lib/cookie.txt`.
- Run the script `get.sh`

Calculate stats (average time, rank, score for both parts):
- Copy & paste your stats in a file (in the same format as on the website)
- Run `stats/stats/py` on the created file
